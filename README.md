Why Antibiotics are Essential in Livestock Farming
Antibiotics are crucial in safeguarding animal health, especially in large-scale farming operations. They help to:
Prevent and Treat Diseases: Livestock, like humans, are prone to bacterial infections. Antibiotics prevent outbreaks and treat diseases effectively.
Enhance Growth and Productivity: When used responsibly, antibiotics contribute to healthier livestock, which translates to improved weight gain and productivity.
